# TO-DO...
* Classes should not have weight-painting on their attachment bones; this is to let us animate those particular bones without dragging along vertices from the classes' meshes.
* Physics meshes improved; currently not easily done on character models, as BreakinBenny noted when doing the above task.
* Mismatched parent bones need being dealt with.
* Classes' feet should absolutely touch the ground, rather than hover centimeters above it.
* Menu poses for class selection menu?
* Current melee-attack animation has funny-arm going on, adjust so the arm doesn't bend oddly.
* Can the Flamethrower's firing animation be made to loop the "firing"? Should be doable if it's a **delta** animation that fades in somewhat smoothly, and out when you stop firing.
* Third person reloads are currently not used at all.
